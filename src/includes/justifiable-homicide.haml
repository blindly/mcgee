    When does the killing of political leaders become morally justifiable?
  %p
    Killing the Hitlers, Stalins and Pol Pots of the world is easy to justify.

    future generations to kill them. But what if our leaders are merely idiots,
    or perhaps corrupt, petty tyrants who are not in the same league as Hitler,
    Stalin or Pol Pot? How much damage can we allow them to do, how many of our
    rights can we allow them to take away, before killing them becomes
    justifiable homicide?
