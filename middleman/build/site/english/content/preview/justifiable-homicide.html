            <h3>1</h3>

            <p><strong>1:17 a.m.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Kendall (Miami)</strong></p>

            <p>
              <i>"Ay, Raul, you’re so much bigger than my brother!"</i>

              squealed Gabriella Acosta as she mounted Raul Rodriguez and ground her pelvis into him.
              She didn't mind that he was seventeen years older. Raul's power was intoxicating.  His influence extended throughout Miami’s Cuban community.
              Most women thought he was sexy, and tonight he belonged to her.
            </p>

            <p>
              <i>"What!? You did it with your brother?"</i>

              She laughed.

              <i>"Of course not, silly. But when we were children I caught him masturbating once. I still tease him about it."</i>
            </p>

            <p>
              He smirked and they resumed their activities. Gabriella moved with the grace and strength of an untamed mare in the wild.
              She bent forward and started kissing Raul while Celia Cruz’s Guantanamera played softly in the background.
              A beautiful young woman, Gabriella’s light brown skin glistened with perspiration as she straddled Raul.
              A breeze through the window tickled her body with the sweet breath of the night air.
            </p>

            <p>
              <i>"I can taste the Cuba Libre on your breath, papi. I like it."</i>

              He smiled, squeezed her ass and reached to the nightstand for his Bacardi and Coke. He took a sip, then passed it to her.
              Gabriella returned to a vertical position, put the glass to her lips and drank. She dipped her index and middle fingers into the tumbler
              and retrieved the last drops. She glazed her right nipple with the liquid, and sucked the residue from her digits.
              Raul’s expression was exactly what she was looking for. As she allowed the glass to roll off her fingers,
              he thrust his hips upward and rose to indulge in the mixture.

              Gabriella inhaled deeply and confirmed her pleasure while the ecstasy electrified her body.

              <i>"Ah! YES!"</i>
            </p>

            <center><strong>***</strong></center>

            <p>
            Santos could hear voices trickling down from the second floor as he edged toward the foot of the stairway, a few feet ahead of his fellow assassin.
            Midnight shrouded the house, except for a shaft of light emanating from inside the bedroom.
            Soft soled shoes made their ascent along the tiled steps undetectable. Halfway up, the conversation grew clearer. They expected Raul to be alone,
            but his guest was no deterrent. Now would be their best opportunity. By the time they reached the last few steps, each word became distinct.
            It was time to proceed with the plan. The partners exchanged a nod and stepped into the room.
            </p>

            <p>
            Gabriella noticed them first as the two men, dressed in black from head to toe, appeared stealthily from the shadows of the upstairs hall.
            She screamed in absolute terror, jumped off her lover and sank to the floor. She hugged her knees, rocked back and forth and prayed.
            Each gripped a Sig Sauer SP2022 9mm pistol with suppressor. It was considerably louder than the .22 caliber Ruger Mark 3 Target pistol
            people in their profession preferred, but this undertaking was engineered to resemble the work of amateurs, so the 9mm was a more appropriate choice.
            </p>

            <p>
            Rodriguez turned to see what caused Gabriella’s sudden panic. The executioners had a clear shot. They steadied their pistols and fired. Santos splattered Raul’s brains on the wall with
            two shots to the head while his partner pumped three rounds into his torso. Such a scene was much too sloppy to be anything but the work of novices. That’s exactly how they wanted it to appear.

            Santos’s accomplice turned toward him and nodded in the direction of Gabriella. “What should we do with her? She can identify us.”

            <i>"Yeah, you’re right."</i>

            <p>
            Santos pointed his gun at her head, set his finger on the trigger, then hesitated. Smeared mascara highlighted her swollen, red eyes.
            She stared downward except for a few fluttering glances up at her attacker. Crawling to her knees, backing away, she begged,

            <i>"Please, don’t kill me. I won’t call the police. I won’t tell anybody. I have a son. Please. Who will raise him?"</i>

            Santos released the pressure from the trigger but continued to point the gun at her. He thought,

            <i>"She looks a lot like my sister, about five-foot four. Same long, chestnut brown hair and dark eyes."</i>

            Gabriella was clearly from the same gene pool as his Cuban ancestors.
            </p>

            <p>
            The women he’d dispatched in the past wore burqas. He usually shot them from a distance, sometimes just for fun. He justified his actions by convincing himself he’d prevent the birth of 10 or more future enemy combatants for each woman slain. This time it was up close and personal. He didn’t feel good about it, but knew what he had to do.

            Santos lowered his aim from her head to her heart and pulled the trigger. One well-placed shot did it, but he fired another round to complete the scene. The force of the hollow points thrust her body back a few feet, and then dropped her to the floor. She died instantly.

            He heard his partner’s voice from behind him.
            </p>

            <p>
            <i>"Have you forgotten our training? Why didn’t you keep to protocol and shoot her in the head?"</i>

            <i>"She’s a civilian. And she’s Cuban. Her family’s entitled to an open-casket funeral. Her son should be able to look at her face one last time and say 'good-bye'."</i>

            <i>"Yeah. All right, all right. Let’s get outta here."</i>

            The colleague placed a note on the bed. It read, in English and Spanish,

            <i>"Those who criticize the Cuban embargo will be silenced."</i>

            The men both had FBI files, but it wouldn’t matter because there wouldn’t be a shred of evidence left at the scene. They wore gloves. No fingerprints. No DNA. Santos picked up the shell casings.
          </p>
          <p>
            As they exited the bedroom, Santos turned around for one last look at Gabriella. She lay on her back. Arms limp as a rag doll, head tilted toward the door.
            Even in death she was beautiful. Her eyes appeared fixed on him. Her open mouth looked like she’d whispered to him,

            <i>"Why? Why me?"</i>

            She was the first Cuban woman he’d ever executed. He’d been living by the sword, on and off, for nearly ten years, first with the military,
            then as a part-time assassin who had just one client. As he walked toward the stairs, he wondered when it would be his turn to die… and how it would come to pass.
