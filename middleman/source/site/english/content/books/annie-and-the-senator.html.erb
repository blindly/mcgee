            <h3>Story</h3>

            <p>Annie Chan. Half Chinese, half Thai. Daughter of a Bangkok pole dancer. Her beauty and other talents catapulted her into the world of high-priced Hong Kong escorts. Her life changed when her millionaire lover sent her to America to get an education. A few years later she emerged from Harvard with an MBA and CPA. With a little help from her friend she rose to the position of president at one of the largest banks in Miami.</p>

            <p>Her career was going along well until a certain senator started causing problems for her. When he threatened to expose her past and destroy her career, she decided she had to silence him. The problem is, she didnâ€™t know how to do it. Not right away, that is.</p>
