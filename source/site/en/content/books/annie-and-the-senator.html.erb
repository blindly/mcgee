intro_two: A few years later she emerged from Harvard with an MBA and CPA. With a little help from her friend she rose to the position of president at one of the largest banks in Miami.
intro_three: Her career was going along well until a certain senator started causing problems for her. When he threatened to expose her past and destroy her career, she decided she had to silence him. The problem is, she didnâ€™t know how to do it. Not right away, that is.
