            <h3>Premise</h3>

            <p>What would YOU do if the TSA sexually assaulted YOUR mother? If you’re a red-blooded American, you’d do the same thing James Young did. What did James Young do? You’ll have to read the story.
This book really highlights the effects that governmental abuse of power and paranoia can do to individual lives. In this short novel James Young decides that he has had enough and decides to do something about it. The legal system has failed him. The solution is vigilante justice. </p>
